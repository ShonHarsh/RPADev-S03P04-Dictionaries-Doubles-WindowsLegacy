# S03P04 Dictionaries & Doubles

This project is my solution in **Windows Legacy (Deprecated), C#** to the **Dictionaries & Doubles** practice found in section 03 practice 04 of the UiPath - RPA Developer Foundation course.

### Getting Started

After making a pull request or downloading the project, open the Main.xaml in UiPath Studio.  The robot can be run with the play button in the ribbon and the result can be seen in output panel.

### Practice Requirements

###### **Calculate the combined weight of the packages sent to one city**

Consider the database of a shipping company containing people and the packages they are sending to certain cities across the world, along with their weight. The database is a Dictionary with the key of String type (the names of the persons) and the values of Dictionary (String/Cities, Double/Weight) type.

Please calculate the overall weight for one city destination. Once this is done, the user should be presented with an input dialog containing the distinct list of cities present in the input data dictionary. If the user chooses no value from the input dialog, print "Nothing chosen by the user"; otherwise you can print "The combined weight of the packages sent to <ChosenCity> is x.xx" (use double digits).

**Note**: For input data, download the workflow below, which already has the Dictionary defined.

New Dictionary(Of String, Dictionary(Of String, Double)) From {

{"John C", New Dictionary(Of String, Double) From {{"Madrid",2.1},{"Paris",1.1}}  },

{"Sarah C", New Dictionary(Of String, Double) From {{"New York",2.1},{"Paris",3.3},{"Berlin", 0.8}}  },

{"Kyle R", New Dictionary(Of String, Double) From {{"San Francisco",2.8},{"New York",1.1}}  },

{"Johnny B", New Dictionary(Of String, Double) From {{"New York",2.1},{"Paris",3.3}, {"Cairo",1.3}, {"Chicago",1.9}}  }}

### Details

**Course:** UiPath - RPA Developer Foundation

**Section:** 03 Data Manipulation

### Sample Output

```sh
07/22/2021 10:20:17 => [Debug] Execution started for project: RPADev-S03P04-Dictionaries-Doubles
07/22/2021 10:20:18 => [Info] RPADev-S03P04-Dictionaries-Doubles execution started
07/22/2021 10:20:27 => [Debug] The combined weight of the packages sent to Paris is 7.7.
07/22/2021 10:20:27 => [Info] RPADev-S03P04-Dictionaries-Doubles execution ended in: 00:00:08
```

### Architecture Requirements

A standard UiPath, Studio to Orchestrator cloud setup is the base of operation.  It is easy to setup and free.
1. An Orchestrator connection - Visit https://cloud.uipath.com/ and authenticate or sign up.
2. [UiPath Studio](https://www.uipath.com/product/studio) is used to run the robot.  Note that Studio Web can be used directly in Orchestrator but I recommend installing the Studio IDE application.
